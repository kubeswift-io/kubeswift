# KubeSwift Documentation

KubeSwift is a Kubernetes-native VM runtime built on Cloud Hypervisor (default) and QEMU (GPU workloads). VMs are first-class Kubernetes workloads defined by CRDs and reconciled by controllers. Each guest runs as a pod; swiftletd inside that pod launches the hypervisor.

## Documents

### [quickstart.md](quickstart.md)
Getting started guide. Install KubeSwift, boot your first disk-boot VM (Ubuntu Noble), boot a kernel-boot microVM (faas-minimal), connect via console and SSH, and run lifecycle commands.

### [architecture.md](architecture.md)
Comprehensive architecture reference. System diagram, control plane components (SwiftImage, SwiftKernel, SwiftGPU, SwiftGuest controllers), runtime plane (swiftletd, hypervisor dispatch, serial socket), all three boot paths, networking model (tap + bridge + dnsmasq), status reporting via pod annotations, and GPU architecture.

### [crds.md](crds.md)
Full CRD reference for all 7 resources: SwiftGuest, SwiftGuestClass, SwiftImage, SwiftSeedProfile, SwiftKernel, SwiftGPUProfile, SwiftGPUNode. Covers every spec and status field, types, defaults, validation rules, mutual exclusivity rules, and example manifests.

### [gpu-passthrough.md](gpu-passthrough.md)
GPU operator guide. Prerequisites (IOMMU, vfio-pci, Fabric Manager), GPU compatibility tier table, step-by-step workflow (label node → discovery → profile → guest), SwiftGPUProfile examples for each tier, SwiftGPUNode inspection, Fabric Manager setup, and troubleshooting.

### [swiftguestpool-guide.md](swiftguestpool-guide.md)
SwiftGuestPool operational guide. Creating pools, scaling, rolling updates, high availability with topology spread, persistent data with volumeClaimTemplates, GPU inference fleets, CI/CD runner pools, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

### [swiftctl.md](swiftctl.md)
CLI reference for all commands: `console`, `ssh`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `describe`, `logs`, `debug`. Covers flags, behavior, requirements, examples, and transport details for console and SSH.

### [development.md](development.md)
Contributor guide. Repository structure, build commands (Go + Rust + images), deploy workflow, CRD workflow (make generate + copy + redeploy), test commands, design principles, adding new controllers/types/crates, debugging procedures, and known version constraints.
